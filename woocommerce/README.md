<p align="center">
WooCommerce is a powerful, customizable e-commerce platform built on WordPress. It provides a robust set of tools and services for businesses to establish and manage their online stores with ease.

This app wraps the WooCommerce API into a comprehensive set of loaders/actions/workflows,
enabling non-technical users to interact with and manage their headless commerce solution efficiently.

# Installation

1. Install via DecoHub.
2. Complete the required fields:

   1. **Store URL**: Enter the URL of your WooCommerce store. For example, if your store is accessible at www.store.com, make sure to use this URL.
   2. **Consumer Key**: Obtain this from the WooCommerce settings. [Follow this guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/) for instructions on generating your API keys.
   3. **Consumer Secret**: Obtain this alongside the Consumer Key from WooCommerce.

Optional Step: To use a custom search engine (such as Algolia or Typesense), you will need to provide the API Key and API Token. [Refer to this guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/#authentication) for generating these credentials.

Configure WooCommerce to send updates to this app by adding Deco as an affiliate. To do this, [follow this guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/#authentication) and use the following endpoint as the notification URL:
- `https://{account}.deco.site/live/invoke/woocommerce/actions/trigger.ts`

Configure the event listener in Deco. To do this:
- Open Blocks > Workflows
- Create a new instance of `events.ts` by clicking on `+`
- Name the block `woocommerce-trigger`. Note that this name is crucial and should not be altered.

ðŸŽ‰ Your WooCommerce setup is complete! You should now see WooCommerce loaders/actions/workflows available for your sections.
