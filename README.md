# Deco Standard **Apps** Library

<img align="right" src="/assets/logo.svg" height="150px" alt="The Deco Framework logo: A capybara in its natural habitat">

Welcome to the `deco-cx/apps` repository! This repository is home to a collection of powerful apps that can be seamlessly integrated into your deco sites. Here, we provide you with a brief overview of the deco framework and introduce the concept of apps. We'll also delve into the repository structure, how to contribute, and more. Read more about apps in the [docs](https://www.deco.cx/docs/en/concepts/app), also if you want to see apps in action check our [storefront](https://github.com/deco-sites/storefront) repository.

## About the deco Framework

Deco, formerly known as `live`, is a modern and versatile framework that empowers developers to build dynamic and interactive websites with ease. Apps are a fundamental component of deco, offering a way to bundle sets of blocks together, all configured through an intuitive UI and sharing a common state defined within the app module.

## Repository Structure

The `deco-cx/apps` repository is structured as a monorepo, housing a collection of individual apps, each stored in a dedicated subfolder. These apps can be installed separately, providing you with the flexibility to choose and integrate only the functionalities that suit your project's needs.

The `deco.ts` file serves as a hub where you can specify the apps of this repository. However it is important to notice that whether you choose to create apps within this repository or within your own organization's repository, there are no limitations on where apps should be developed.

## Overview

At the core of all websites within this repository is the `website` app, located in the `website` folder. This app lays the foundation for websites, offering a set of common features that are essential regardless of whether your site is an e-commerce platform or not. We've also structured the repository to accommodate specific platforms, such as e-commerce platforms like VTEX, Shopify, VNDA, and more. These platform-specific apps depend on the `website` app, leveraging its shared features while adding platform-specific functionality.

## Contributing

Contributions to the `deco-cx/apps` repository are highly encouraged! We maintain an open and collaborative environment where community members are valued and respected. When contributing, please follow our contribution guidelines and treat others with kindness and professionalism. Our review process ensures high-quality contributions that align with the repository's goals.

We adhere to **semantic versioning**, and all apps within this repository are versioned collectively using git tags. To release a new version, simply fork the repository, open a pull request, and once approved, request any maintainer to run `deno task release`. There are no strict rules about release frequency, so you can release updates as soon as your changes are merged into the main branch.

### Developing a new app

Just run:

```sh
deno task new `APP_NAME` && deno task start
```

The app folder and the `deco.ts` will be changed in order to support your newly created app.

Then you can run the watcher in a site that you own,

```sh
deno task watcher $SITE_NAME
```

## Transition from deco-sites/std to deco-cx/apps

This repository isn't a deco site as it used to be in `deco-sites/std`. In the past, we used `deco-sites/std` as a central hub for various platform integrations. Now, we've modularized these integrations into smaller, installable, and composable apps. These apps now reside in the `deco-cx/apps` repository. Additionally, the `/compat` folder contains two apps, `$live` and `deco-sites/std`, which serve as drop-in replacements for the older apps that contained all blocks together. As users progressively adopt the new apps, they can take full advantage of app extensibility and enhance their websites' capabilities.

We're excited to have you as part of the Deco community and look forward to seeing the incredible apps and websites you'll create using the `deco-cx/apps` repository. Happy coding!
